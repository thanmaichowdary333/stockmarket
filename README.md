UI/UX Implementation
Overview of the User Interface (UI)
Application UI Description:

Provides an intuitive web interface for users to enter stock price details and receive predicted trading volume.

UI consists of an input form (index.html) and a result page (output.html) styled with CSS (style.css).

Core UI Components:

Input Form: Users enter Open, High, Low, and Close prices.

Submit Button: Triggers model prediction.

Prediction Display: Shows forecasted stock volume.

Navigation Link: Allows users to return and make another prediction.

User Flow & Navigation
User visits the homepage (index.html).

Inputs stock price values and submits the form.

Backend processes the data and generates predictions.

User is redirected to output.html with the predicted stock volume.

User can return to the homepage for a new prediction.

Design Principles & Aesthetics
Minimalist Design:

Dark-themed stock market background for a professional look.

Semi-transparent containers ensure readability.

Simple typography (Georgia, sans-serif) enhances clarity.

Usability Enhancements:

Clear labeling for input fields.

Responsive design for different screen sizes.

Hover effects for buttons to improve interactivity.

Responsiveness & Cross-Platform Compatibility
Responsive Features:

CSS media queries ensure proper display on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Flexible container widths adjust dynamically.

Testing Across Devices:

Verified on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

Ensured consistency across different screen sizes.

User Accessibility & Inclusivity
Accessibility Considerations:

High contrast text for readability.

Large input fields & buttons for ease of use.

Keyboard navigable form fields.

Catering to Users with Disabilities:

Screen-reader compatibility.

Keyboard shortcuts for navigation.

User Testing & Feedback
Testing Conducted:

Internal team testing for UI responsiveness & functionality.

Beta testing with users to gather usability feedback.

User Feedback & Improvements:

Issue: Initial UI lacked clarity in button styling → Solution: Enhanced button contrast and hover effects.

Issue: Users requested a "Clear Input" button → Solution: Added reset functionality.

Conclusion
The project successfully integrates real-time stock data with machine learning predictions.

The UI/UX design ensures accessibility and ease of use for traders and analysts.

The model's performance is optimized for accuracy and scalability.

Future enhancements could include additional technical indicators and real-time alerts for traders.
